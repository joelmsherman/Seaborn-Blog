# Basic Dataframe Visualization Using Seaborn

Objective:  As I learn new tools and packages in Python, my goal is to synthesize the information I've learned on datasets near and dear to my heart, work them into a notebook, and try to teach others through blog posts on the topic.  This post will be on (very) basic dataframe visualization using Python's Seaborn package.

Dataset: Data is my personal training, heart rate, heart rate variability and sleep data that I track daily as part of my cycling training and recovery metrics.
